# User Interface/User Experience (WP1)
User-centered design is a fundamental component of the iReceptor Plus project and is the foundation of Work Package 1 (WP1). The objective of this WP is to establish a communication channel with the users and to ensure that the communication informs the design and implementation across all the work packages. In order to identify their requirements, use cases are elicited from the user community at the beginning of the project to guide initial development, with their feedback gathered continually throughout the project as the platform develops. Use cases and user feedback will be critical in the development of the tools in the platform, such as the Scientific Gateway (WP1), but all work packages will consider the fundamental use cases during platform development.
